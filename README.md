## Timeline
+ We started by identifying the hypothetical needs our user would need filled.
+ We then created a dataset for test functionality 
+ Logo and enter page created
+ The UI was deployed 
+ We decided to use Handlebars
+ The UI had to be reconfigured 
+ POST function was configured.
+ Heroku configured
+ Issues began when we struggled to get our DB to push to our UI
+ Login Form Added
+ IMAGES began to append
+ Validation completed. 
+ Finally got DB to push only on our local host
+ Catalog GET functionality only on local host 
+ Turns out our heroku issues and our DB issues were one and the same. No one had configured JAWS.
